# Freelance developer project

The idea is to create an Application (web + mobile) to help freelancers find the right set of projects for themselves. Existing
freelacer sites have no provision for new freelancers to start off their journey. Its more like a competition right now where the cheapest and the most experinced bidder gets the project. Machine learning could be used here to guide new as well as existing freelancers for the best bid depending on the requirements of the project. There will be a form with various inputs that will have to be filled by the business/person wanting to hire freelancers. That form will consist of fields that will have to be filled with the exact type of requirements by the company/person for the project.

After the post is made, the machine learning algorithm will analyze the requirements and provide an expected range of cost that the company/person can expect for the kind of work they wants to get done. The same will be applicable to the freelancer who wants to bid on the project so as to encourage a fair bidding practice which is largely absent today. This will ensure a quality pay for quality work.
